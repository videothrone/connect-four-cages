# Connect Four Cages

Connect Four Cages is a variation on the [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game. Done during my stint at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/). The first proper project we did and also a tribute to Nicolas Cage.
